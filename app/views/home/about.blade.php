				<p>This site has one goal.  To score the achievement hunter videos.  We base this on who competes and who wins.  We track the rounds by game played, actors (or teams) involved and by who wins.  Some consideration is taken for co-op games and wave based games as well.</p>
				<br />
				<p>Recently we have begun tracking the RT Podcast, the patch and quotes for any videos we find hilarious.  We hope you enjoy.</p>
